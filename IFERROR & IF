# Better to use iferror whenever results are same and expression tested for an error,
their is no need to duplicate the expression in two place and the code is safer and more readable
IFERROR( SALES[Qty] * Sales[Price], Blank())
# However, a developer should use IF when they want to return the result of different expression
IF(
  ISERROR( Sales[Qty] * Sales[Price]),
  Blank(),
  Sales[Qty] * Sales[Price]
  )
